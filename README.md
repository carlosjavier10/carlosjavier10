- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @carlosjavier10
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in learning about programming and learning enough to enter the job market that is currently so proficient yet exciting and innovative.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning PHP with HTML and CSS which inevitably leads me to javascript, I consider that my level is low but even so I have taken forward several projects that are in production and that encourage me to learn more.
- ðŸ“« If in any way you think I can collaborate or any of my projects can help you in any way, I'll be happy to help and if you need to contact me my work email is info@tuminitienda.com
